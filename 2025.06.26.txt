The strains within the LP.8.1 lineage that still exhibit growth potential based on recent data include: LP.8.1.1, NW.1.1.1, and NY.3.1.1.

 


Within the LF.7 lineage, strains that still exhibit potential for transmission include: LF.7.7.1, PY.1, and LF.7.9.1.




The recent emergence of the S:H1088R mutation in some NB.1.8.1 lineage strains is quite intriguing. Mutations at nearby sites have already demonstrated potential driving potential in KP.1, JN.1.13, and XFG.3.1. Therefore, the S:H1088R mutation may also become a potentially enhancing mutation!
