The strains within the LP.8.1 lineage that still exhibit growth potential based on recent data include: LP.8.1.1, NW.1.1.1, and NY.3.1.1.

 


Within the LF.7 lineage, strains that still exhibit potential for transmission include: LF.7.7.1, PY.1, and LF.7.9.1.




The recent emergence of the S:H1088R mutation in some NB.1.8.1 lineage strains is quite intriguing. Mutations at nearby sites have already demonstrated potential driving potential in KP.1, JN.1.13, and XFG.3.1. Therefore, the S:H1088R mutation may also become a potentially enhancing mutation!



The emergence of the S:F59S mutation in XFG lineage marks the beginning of a new active phase for both S:F59S and S:S60P mutations. Notably, the S:F59S mutation has already been observed in NB.1.8.1, while the S:S60P mutation is predicted to likely emerge in subsequent evolutionary branches of NB.1.8.1, particularly in PY.1, with a high probability of occurrence. Additionally, following the acquisition of S:F59S by XFG, a triple mutation combination (S:T22N, S:S31P, S:F59S) has formed. Previously, when these three mutations co-occurred - due to staggered infections by strains like KP.3.1.1 and XEC - antibody-mediated pressure resulted in reduced infection efficiency. The current emergence of S:F59S suggests a weakening of this specific immune constraint.
