Regarding the Points Leaderboard section, this leaderboard data has been collected over a long period of time, and some of the data may not reflect recent data.


XBB.1.5 has a new approach, XBB.1.5.72 still has a high percentage over a long period of time but does not have a lot of momentum in the later stages, GK.1.1 is the one that has appeared more frequently apart from XBB.1.5.72 but this is the one that has appeared as a potential grower more recently, XBB.1.5.10 has had some potential for growth initially but the later stages have shown that this potential for growth is declining, and GK.2 is a late-appearing potential grower, but seems unable to beat GK.1.1 at this time.The three branches to keep an eye on may be XBB.1.5.72 and GK.1.1, GK.2, and there is another that doesn't show up in the data, but has never met the conditions to be recorded, which appears to be HZ.1.


XBB.1.9 family: FL.1.5.1, EG.6.1, HN.1, XBB.1.9.1.
HN.1 was entered into the conditions too late for the data to actually show its true potential, and with that in mind, this bust is hereby promoted as to the data.


EG.5.1 family: EG.5.1.1, EG.5.1.3, HV.1.

XBB.1.16 Family: First Order: XBB.1.16.6, XBB.1.16.1, XBB.1.16.11, FU.2, HF.1.


The Second Step:FU.1, XBB.1.16.15, FU.2.1.


XBB.2.3 family: GJ.1.2, GE.1, XBB.2.3.11.

Among the XBB.2.3 family, XBB.2.3.3 has also seen a lot of growth recently.


Strains with more growth potential in recent times include JF.1, JG.3, HV.1, GK.1.4, GW.5.1.1, HK.3.1, HK.3.2, FL.20.2, FL.1.5.2. FL.31.1, FL.32.1, EG.5.1.8，JP.1，GK.2.1.1，GS.5，JM.1，JD.1。
