The virus strains that may have growth potential at the current stage include:
XEC.5，MJ.1.1，XEC.4，XEC.7，LP.8.1，LP.8.2，NL.2，NL.3，NL.6，NL.7，MJ.2.1，MC.10.2，MC.19，MC.20.




The virus strains within the KP.3.1.1 family that still have certain potential are: MC.10, MC.13, MC.2, MC.16, and MC.1.




The strain with the S:D111N mutation should perhaps be designated as KP.3.1.1.
