In the recent period, the potential members of the KP.3 family include:KP.3.1.1，KP.3.3，KP.3.1.




In the recent period, the virus strains with potential growth advantages include:
LF.9.1，XDV.1.7.1，XDV.1.9.1，LZ.2.1.


The S:A435S mutation is a relatively convergent mutation that has attracted attention recently, and it should be given due importance.


Recently, XEC has been considered a highly potential candidate for the next phase of potential virus strains, in addition to some similar recombinant strains. Furthermore, XEC has a relatively formidable competitor, LF.7. While LF.7 may not necessarily compete successfully against XEC, this variant still poses a certain degree of epidemiological threat.


It's concerning that XEC already has a designated lineage and there are numerous other lineages that have yet to be assigned. Among these, a particular lineage that lacks the spike mutation but carries other non-spike mutations is of particular interest. I am worried that this lineage could emerge as a significant player, akin to the likes of EG.5.1.1 and JN.1.4.
