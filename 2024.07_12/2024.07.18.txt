Under the current situation, KP.3.1.1, KP.3.1, KP.3.3.1, KP.3.3, KP.3.2.3, and KP.3.2 in the KP.3 family continue to account for a relatively high proportion worldwide.




Under the current circumstances, the newly designated strains that may have growth potential include: MJ.1, MG.1, KP.2.17, KP.3.3.2, KP.4.2.3, LF.5, JN.1.48.3, MF.2, MH.1, LB.1.8, MM.2, MK.1, KP.3.4.1, KP.3.5, MN.1, JN.1.66, LB.1.4.1, LB.1.7.1, and LB.1.7.3.




There are two new mutations, S:G35R and S:N185D, that may potentially have growth potential. S:N185D was previously the defining mutation of CH.1.1.1, and it also showed a period of convergence during the XBB era. S:G35R, on the other hand, is a relatively newer mutation that has been showing an increasing trend in its prevalence recently. Alongside S:G35R, another mutation, S:T22N, which was previously identified, is also appearing with increasing frequency.
