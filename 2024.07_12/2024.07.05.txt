Under the current circumstances, the virus strains with potential for growth may include the following branches: KP.1.1.5, KP.3.1.5, LP.3, LW.1, KP.4.1.1, KP.4.1.2, KP.4.1.3, XDD.3, LB.1.3.1, LF.3.1.1, MA.1, JN.1.18.6, LY.1, JN.1.18.7, LZ.1, MB.1.1, LP.1.1, MC.1, LF.4.1, KP.3.3.1, MD.1, MD.2, MD.3.1, LK.2.1, JN.1.7.8, ME.1ï¼ŒXDD.3.



In recent times, the KP.3 family has been dominated by KP.3.1, KP.3.3.1, KP.3.1.1, KP.3.2, and KP.3.2.3 as the main prevalent strains.



Under the current circumstances, convergent mutations that may have a gain-of-function effect include S:T22N, S:S31del/S:S31P, S:F59S/S:F59L, S:S60P/S:S60F, S:V62F, S:H445P/S:H445R, S:T547K, and S:V622A mutations.
