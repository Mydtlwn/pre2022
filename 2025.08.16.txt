Some excellent and potentially significant viral strains.
XFG.3.4.1: The XFG.3.4.1 strain is a descendant lineage of the XFG strain, featuring a total of twelve key spike mutations including S:T22N, S:S31P, S:K182N, S:R190S, S:R346T, S:K444R, S:H445R, S:F456L, S:N487D, S:Q493E, S:T572I, and S:S680P.Among these, two major convergent mutations - S:S680X and S:K679X - have emerged in both the XFG family and the NB.1.8.1 family, potentially heralding the advent of the next major era of convergent mutations. These mutations are not only widely prevalent in European/American regions but also show extensive distribution in Asian regions, warranting vigilance.




The XFG.5.2 strain also demonstrates considerable potential, particularly as some sublineages carry mutations analogous to those in the XFG.3.4.1 strain, predominantly clustered around sites 679-680. Several other sublineages within this lineage also exhibit significant potential, with multiple emerging branches collectively driving the sustained growth of the XFG.5.2 strain and even stimulating its mutation potential. This suggests that heightened vigilance toward this strain may be warranted.



The XFG.3.1 strain represents an early-branching lineage of the XFG virus with demonstrated growth potential, and notably, novel recombinant variants derived from this lineage have shown exceptional characteristics. XFG.3.1 harbors twelve spike mutations including S:T22N, S:S31P, S:K182R, S:R190S, S:R346T, S:K444R, S:H445R, S:F456L, S:N487D, S:Q493E, S:T572I, and S:D1084G.Key evolutionary trajectories appear to involve subsequent variants of the XFG.3.1.2 sublineage, suggesting that these emerging variants may warrant formal designation and enhanced surveillance.



The PQ.2.1 strain represents a descendant lineage of NB.1.8.1, characterized by the novel S:I478T mutation that has emerged across multiple sublineages. As one of the two major evolutionary branches within the PQ.2 family, this variant harbors seven spike mutations including S:T22N, S:F59S, S:G184S, S:A435S, S:F456L, S:I478T, and S:Q493E. The widespread appearance of S:I478T across diverse branches underscores its potential evolutionary significance within the PQ.2 lineage.



The PQ.2.2 strain, like its counterpart PQ.2.1, represents a descendant lineage of NB.1.8.1 and harbors eight novel spike mutations including S:T22N, S:F59S, S:G184S, S:A435S, S:F456L, S:K478I, S:Q493E, and S:H1088R. Notably, the S:H1088R mutation has been implicated in driving the strain's proliferation. It should be emphasized that multiple sublineages within PQ.2.2 have already undergone further mutations,suggesting that emerging descendants of this lineage may warrant specific attention and potential designation in viral surveillance systems.
