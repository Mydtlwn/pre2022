Due to the fact that so many strains have been designated in the past few days, I still haven't sorted out the whole thing by now, especially since the number of recombinant strains has increased quite a bit, and the current situation still leaves the possibility that some recombinant strains may be designated in the near future.


Regarding the standings, the XBB.1.5 family and the XBB.1.9 family have the following data: JD.1.1, GK.1.1 as well as FL.1.5.1 and EG.6.1.


The XBB.2.3 family has the following data: GJ.1.2 and GE.1, and although GS.4.1 also made some waves, it showed a downward trend again in the end.


The EG.5.1 family scorecard is as follows: HV.1, EG.5.1.1, EG.5.1.3, HK.3, and EG.5.1.6. Of note is the EG.5.1.6 family, which is currently seeing an increase in the number of strains carrying new mutations, and the expansion of strains with the S:S704L mutation in the HV.1 family.
