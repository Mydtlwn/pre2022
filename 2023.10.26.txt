Due to the fact that so many strains have been designated in the past few days, I still haven't sorted out the whole thing by now, especially since the number of recombinant strains has increased quite a bit, and the current situation still leaves the possibility that some recombinant strains may be designated in the near future.


Regarding the standings, the XBB.1.5 family and the XBB.1.9 family have the following data: JD.1.1, GK.1.1 as well as FL.1.5.1 and EG.6.1.
