Recently, within the XFG family, the XFG.3.1, XFG.3.4.1, and XFG.3 strains currently exhibit the highest growth potential.




Within the NB.1.8.1 family, the primary strains exhibiting significant growth potential are PQ.2.2, PQ.2.1, and PQ.1.2.




Within the recent LF.7 family, PY.1.1.1, PY.1.4.1, and PY.2 have emerged as the predominant variants. Additionally, a novel unspecified yet potentially significant variant has been identified within the PY.1.1.1 lineage.



Within the recent LP.8.1 family, the strains showing significant potential include NY.3.1.1, NY.9, and NW.1.2.

Recently, the convergent frequency of the S:A845S mutation has been notably high. Compared to previous observations, the gain-of-function effects of the S:A845S mutation have significantly increased. Additionally, mutations including S:S680F, S:S680P, S:K679R, and S:K679N are demonstrating enhancedcontributions to viral transmission. Several unspecified lineages carrying the S:I478T and S:T572I mutations have emerged domestically, while the S:K478T mutation is showing higher prevalence internationally. In northern China, the T572I-mutated lineage predominates, whereas southern regions are characterized by PQ.2.2,PQ.20, and various undefined lineages harboring S:I478T mutations. Notably, the PQ.2.2 strain serves as the primary driver of this wave.

Recently, among the specified strains, those that may have potential transmission capacity include:LF.7.12.1，XFU，PQ.4.1，NW.1.5，XFC.1.6，XES.1.1，PP.1.1.1，PW.3，LF.7.10.2，XFG.14.1，XFG.14.2，PQ.5.1.1，XFV，XFS，XFG.3.1.3，XFG.3.1.1，PQ.26，XFG.3.5.1
