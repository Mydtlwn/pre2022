A new phase of the ladder chart.

XBB.1.5 family of ladder diagrams:

First ladder: XBB.1.5.49,EU.1.1,XBB.1.5.37,EU.1.1.1,XBB.1.5.24
Second step: XBB.1.5.1,XBB.1.5.10,XBB.1.5.15,XBB.1.5.67
There has been a violent decline in some early designated variants of the XBB.1.5 family, with even the dark horses of the first two weeks suffering a decline in share, but there is still a potentially large possibility that some XBB.1.5 variants could rise, such as XBB.1.5.70 and the descendants and newly designated XBB.1.5.72, XBB.1.5.81, with the gradual reduction in sequencing Some variants should not adhere too closely to the original
XBB.1.9 family:
First order: XBB.1.9.1,FL.4,EG.1,XBB.1.9.2,,EG.5.1

First order: XBB.1.9.1,FL.4,EG.1,XBB.1.9.2,,EG.5.1
Second step: FL.1,FL.2,EG.4

The XBB.1.16 family: XBB.1.16.1,FU.1,XBB.1.16.2. Additional thanks to all the staff involved in the sequencing, as the analysis of these data has bought everyone a lot of time.
Several strains that may have had a significant advantage in recent times, FL.15, XBB.1.5.70, XBB.1.5.72, XBB.1.5.81, FL.1.5, FL.1.5.1, GK.1

,GE.1,XCD,XBB.8.2,XBB.1.34.1,XBB.1.34.2,XBB.1.5.74,XBB.1.16.9
Possible strains with potential at this stage, FL.15,FL.1.5.1,GK.1. Although strains have been designated as more likely threats, more emphasis should be placed on these three strains now, as subsequent strains gain momentum. We may include new strains for close attention at a later date.
