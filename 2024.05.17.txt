In the current situation, the S:S31del mutation has become a new convergent mutation that increases the growth advantage. Meanwhile, the S:H445P mutation, S:F59S/S:F59L mutation, and S:S60P mutation are mutations that may have a growth advantage in addition to the S:S31del mutation. Besides the above mutations,some virus strains seem to exhibit the S:L1143F mutation, which also displays a certain degree of convergence.
