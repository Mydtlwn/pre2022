At the current stage, the strains within the LF.7 family that still demonstrate potential include: PC.2, LF.7.9, and LF.7.7.2.




Additionally, within the LP.8.1 lineage, the following strains retain transmission potential: LP.8.1.1, LP.8.1.4, and NW.1.



Within the XEC lineage, the strains that retain transmission potential include: XEC.4.1, XEC.25.1, and XEC.4.1.1.


Currently, the NB.1.8.1 and XFG strains demonstrate elevated transmission potential and public health threat, with NB.1.8.1 being particularly notable for its combinatorial spike protein mutations S:A435S and S:Q493E. Notably, the XEC.25.1 variant shares this same mutation profile while exhibiting an expanded combination with additional S:Q493E, S:A435S, and S:T572I substitutions in its spike protein configuration.

The epidemiological trajectory of the combinatorial S:A435S and S:Q493E mutations has achieved near-consensus recognition in scientific communities, with speculation mounting that these mutations may exhibit epistatic interactions. Presently, convergent evolution toward S:A435S is being observed across most XEC lineage variants, encompassing both previously designated strains and newly emerged clusters.

Notably, the NB.1.8.1 lineage has recently spawned multiple sublineages bearing ORF3a mutations, with striking convergence patterns emerging among these branches. This phenomenon warrants sustained surveillance and heightened scientific attention given its potential evolutionary implications.

Beyond the NB.1.8.1 lineage, the XFG strain has demonstrated persistent global dissemination dynamics. As of now, XFG variants - particularly the XFG.2 sublineage - show no signs of epidemiological abatement. This recombinant strain, formed through genetic recombination between LP.8.1.2 and LF.7 parental lineages, carries an array of spike protein mutations that evoke parallels with the XBB lineage complex. Like its XBB counterparts, XFG variants have inherited most ancestral spike mutations, notably retaining the S:K444R, S:H445R, S:N487D, and S:T572I substitutions that characterize this evolutionary cluster.

In the United States, concurrent with XFG circulation, the XFC variant has emerged as another circulating strain. While demonstrating lower overall evolutionary potential compared to XFG, the XFC lineage exhibits distinct mutation profiles including S:K679R, S:K1086R, and S:V1104L substitutions in its spike protein configuration. These divergent mutation patterns warrant continued molecular surveillance to monitor potential phenotypic implications.
