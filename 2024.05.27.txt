Under the current situation, the JN.1 family: First Step: JN.1.16, LB.1, JN.1.7, JN.1.13.1, JN.1.8.1.






The second step includes JN.1.18, JN.1.16.1, and JN.1.4.




Within the JN.1.11.1 family: KP.2, KP.3, and KP.2.3 have a high prevalence rate.


In the recent period, the LB.1+S:S31del strain is still showing rapid growth. Due to some unspecified reasons, we are at a loss for the moment. This strain is currently doubling every two weeks or so.



Under the current situation, virus strains that may have growth potential and advantages include: LL.1, LK.1, KP.1.1.3, KP.3.1.1, KP.2.14, KP.3.2.1, KP.4.2.2, KS.1.1, LF.2, JN.1.18.3, LH.1, LM.1, JN.1.50.1, LJ.1, LN.1.1, XDK.6, XDK.4.1, XDK.5，KR.1.1，KR.2，KR.3，KP.2.15.
