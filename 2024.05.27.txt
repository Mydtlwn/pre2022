Under the current situation, the JN.1 family: First Step: JN.1.16, LB.1, JN.1.7, JN.1.13.1, JN.1.8.1.






The second step includes JN.1.18, JN.1.16.1, and JN.1.4.




Within the JN.1.11.1 family: KP.2, KP.3, and KP.2.3 have a high prevalence rate.


In the recent period, the LB.1+S:S31del strain is still showing rapid growth. Due to some unspecified reasons, we are at a loss for the moment. This strain is currently doubling every two weeks or so.
