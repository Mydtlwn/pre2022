New intriguing mutations, there have been some intriguing mutations in recent times, S:Q14H and S:Q14R are new and frequent mutations lately, this mutation was classified as a priority mutation in the beginning but I didn't pay much attention to it until recently when this mutation has been appearing very frequently, S:Q52H, S:Q52R, these two mutations are the EG.5.1, FL.20 and other strains, I think I should have already written about the S:Q52H mutation.S:E554Q, this mutation has been very highly regarded in our area lately, and some people think that this mutation is more adaptive than S:E554K, I can't say for sure if this is correct or not here, there have been a lot of mutations on S:E554 lately, with the highest frequency on S:E554K, and apart from that S: E554K is the most frequent mutation. E554A, S:E554D, S:E554V, S:E554Q these mutations are gradually appearing. I think there may be other attempts to appear, in addition to some mutations around S:550_559 are starting to appear. s:A222V, this mutation is appearing very frequently these days.
