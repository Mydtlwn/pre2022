The major circulating strains within the KP.3 family in recent times are: KP.3.1, KP.3.3, and KP.3.2.





The JN.1.9.2 family is mainly dominated by LB.1.3 and LB.1.7, with LB.1.3 having multiple branches with additional mutations that have given it an advantage in transmission. Now would be a good time to designate them specifically.


The main JN.1 strains outside of the JN.1.9.2 family and the JN.1.11.1 family include: JN.1.16.1 and JN.1.16.
