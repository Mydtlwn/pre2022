At the current stage, within the BA.2.86 family: First step: JN.1, JN.1.4, JN.1.7, JN.1.8.1, JN.1.4.3.






Second step: JN.1.18, JN.1.13.1, KP.2, JN.1.32.






The potentially virulent strains under the current situation include: KZ.1.1.1, JN.1.7.3, KW.1.1, KV.2, JN.1.4.7, JN.1.42.1, XDV.1, and XDV.




KZ.1.1.1 is currently one of the rare strains that have gathered the first batch of convergent mutations from the BA.2.86 family, namely R346T, L455S, F456L or F456V, and T572I. However, it should be noted that while KP.2.2 is still a bit short of gathering all these mutations, it has acquired a mutation at position 59 of the spike protein, which may be one of the possible second batch of convergent mutations.





The second batch of suspected convergent mutation sites in the spike protein include: 31, 59, 60, 680, and 704.





At the current stage, with the decrease in sequencing efforts worldwide, there are potential hidden dangers and uncertainties left behind regarding virus mutations. In addition, although some regions have conducted a large amount of sequencing, the reduced uploading or failure to upload the data has caused considerable impacts. I hope that countries around the world can resume sequencing efforts and upload sufficient sequencing data.



Currently, the number of virus transmissions in some regions has increased again, including several branches of JN.1.4 that carry non-spike mutations. These branches, despite having non-spike mutations, exhibit significant transmission advantages. It is hoped that some of these branches can be designated as soon as possible and identified among the already uploaded branches.
