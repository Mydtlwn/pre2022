The recent trend hasn't changed much from the previous one, and KP.3 still mainly consists of KP.3.1, KP.3.3, and KP.3.2.





Two combinations of mutations continue to be under scrutiny, with one featuring 346+456+572+31 as the primary mutations, and the other comprising 346+456+572+59 as the key mutations.



The former is a variant strain of LB.1.3+S:T572I and KP.2.3+S:T572I.



The latter is a variant strain of KP.2.2+S:T572I and KP.1.1+S:F59S+S:T572I.



Interestingly, a recently discovered variant of KP.3.1 harbors mutations in S:R346T and S:H445R, along with a clade featuring multiple mutations in ORF1a.


Multiple branches of LB.1.3 are still expanding, some of which are quite interesting and worthy of being designated specifically, while others seem to have not yet garnered the attention they deserve.
