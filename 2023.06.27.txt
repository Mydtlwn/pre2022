New strains that can compete with some of the current lines, GR.1, GS.1, GJ.1, GF.1, EG.5.2, DV.7.1, of which DV.7.1 is the most recently designated line and the only one that is not a descendant of the XBB series.
Next week's ladder will be cut by two places for XBB.1.5, so next week will be reported as 8 places and the ladder for XBB.2.3 may be withdrawn. XBB.1.9 and XBB.1.16 may be added depending on circumstances.
The figures for this step list are as follows:

XBB.1.5 family: 1st ladder: XBB.1.5.37,XBB.1.5.49,GR.1,XBB.1.5.73.

XBB.1.5.13. What can be seen is that XBB.1.5.49 is suppressed, while XBB.1.5.37 shows an advantage, but I don't think the advantage will last long, as GR.1 and XBB.1.5.73 seem to have more potential.
