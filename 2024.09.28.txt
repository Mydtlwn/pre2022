At present, KP.3.1.1, KP.3.3, and KP.3.1 of the KP.3 family still account for the majority of them, while some outstanding branches have emerged in MC.16 of the KP.3.1.1 family, which have not been designated yet.





Regarding the data on XBB appearing in the latest US statistics, I have taken a look at it recently and found that many of the cases labeled as XBB are actually other variants mistakenly identified as XBB. In the past, there have also been issues of misidentification in the data during the period from September to October each year. This time, the main reason for the misidentification is that some virus strains have acquired more convergent mutations, which make some variants resemble XBB, leading to the error. Additionally, there are other recombinant variants involved, which represent the phenomenon of re-recombination between previous recombinant variants and new virus strains, causing some problems in identification.



XEK and XEC.2, the XEK variant strain has previously entered the list in the form of KP.2.3/XEC in global sequencing data, which seems to be quite rare. In past instances, strains like EG.5.1 only appeared in US or global sequencing data lists after being designated, and it was uncommon for strains to enter these lists without prior designation. Of course, this may be closely related to the currently low number of sequencing efforts. XEC.2 seems to have certain transmission advantages compared to XEC.1. Sometimes, certain non-spike mutations may pose a greater transmission threat than spike mutations, as exemplified by EG.5.1.1. Of course, this may also imply that subsequent sub-lineages gradually provide considerable transmission momentum to the main lineage, such as XDV.1.



The two mutations worth noting are S:D111N and S:F58V. The S:D111N mutation alone may not necessarily achieve a favorable outcome. However, if the amino acid at position 111 mutates to asparagine, it may potentially form an N-glycan after the occurrence of S:K113T. Although an N-glycan has not yet formed, it warrants vigilance, given the many precedents where convergent evolution has occurred at neighboring sites followed by a convergent site. S:F58V could be a mutation of interest. Previously, there have been gradual convergent mutations such as S:F59S/S:F59L, S:S60P, S:V62F, and S:A67V. Considering that S:F58V is located near these sites, the probability of convergent evolution occurring is high. However, the S:F58V mutation may lack sustained effectiveness.



Three noteworthy mutation combinations: 1. S:T22N + S:F59S or S:T22N + S:F59L, this combination has been repeatedly verified as advantageous in multiple virus strains that have been under continuous observation; 2. S:T22N + S:S60P, this combination is currently only present in a few virus strains, however, there is still a significant possibility that it could lead to wider epidemic spread and convergence; 3. S:T22N + S:V62F, this combination appears in a virus strain from the Asian region and remains a target of concern with certain potential on XDV.1. It is currently uncertain whether it brings any benefits, and it may not have as much growth potential as the first combination, but current research has yet to prove this point.
