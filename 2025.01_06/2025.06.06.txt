In the most recent period, the strains within the LP.8.1 family that have demonstrated relatively faster growth potential are primarily LP.8.1.1, NY.9, and NY.3.1.1.



Within the LF.7 family, the predominant variants are primarily composed of the following strains: LF.7.7.2, LF.7.9.1, and PL.1.1!



The most frequently observed convergent mutations include S:T345S, S:K440R, S:L441R, S:R765L, and N:R204P. These mutations have been identified in globally prevalent variants as well as in certain regional variants. Notably, the S:T345S and S:K440R mutations demonstrate a relatively higher concentration in their distribution patterns.


The S:T345S mutation can synergize effectively with the S:R346T mutation. Furthermore, in the absence of the S:R346T mutation, the S:T345S mutation alone serves as a viable functional substitute. This is particularly advantageous in scenarios involving immune-experienced individuals who have encountered multiple exposures to viral strains carrying the S:R346T mutation.


The paradoxical observation that certain combinations of viral mutations initially exhibit relatively slow growth rates, only to subsequently experience accelerated proliferation after a prolonged period, may be attributed to the specificity of antibodies generated from prior infections rather than inherent incompatibility with the viral backbone. For instance, in the context of BA.5 and BQ.1.1 infections in the United States, strains carrying the S:L452R mutation initially struggled to compete with XBB variants lacking this mutation. However, as the level of targeted antibodies wanes over time, XBB sublineages harboring the S:L452R mutation can revive and regain competitive advantage.

In subsequent BA.3.2 sublineages, if mutations occur at the S:455 and S:456 spike protein sites, the variants carrying S:L455R and either S:F456S or S:F456V mutations are more likely to achieve competitive dominance. Consequently, branches with S:L455S or S:F456L mutations may not necessarily outcompete those three mutated variants in this evolutionary contest.


The S:L441R and S:K440R mutations may confer similar functional advantages, both potentially enhancing the transmissibility of certain viral strains. Notably, sublineages carrying the S:K440R mutation warrant particular attention due to their potential transmission risks.



The S:R765L and S:R765S mutations may exhibit epistatic interactions with the S:R346T mutation, potentially leading to enhanced transmissibility through synergistic effects.


Under current circumstances, the N:R204P mutation represents a non-spike convergent mutation. However, the emerging prevalence of diverse sublineages carrying this mutation suggests it may confer a potential growth advantage in the evolving viral landscape.
