The currently existing strains within the KP.3.1.1 family that still possess potential advantages include: MC.16, MC.13, MC.1, MC.11, and MC.2.






The strains within the LB.1 family that currently still have growth potential include: LB.1.7, LB.1.3.1, and LB.1.3.



Currently, there is a virus strain with a multi-spike mutation that warrants attention. Although there is only one sequence of this strain identified so far, it has acquired the mutations S:T76I and S:A67T. It is now established that S:A67V is a relatively convergent mutation. Although this mutation still lags significantly behind others, the impact of S:A67T remains uncertain.



The LF.7 branch has begun to grow extensively, affecting regions in the United States and Qatar, particularly a certain branch carrying the S:A475V mutation. As for the branch affecting the United States, we have not yet determined which specific branch is responsible.


The emergence of two distinct virus strains with the mutations S:I68F and S:I68T is noteworthy. It is alarming that these two mutations may have already undergone convergent evolution. Additionally, more convergent branches with the S:D111N mutation are starting to appear, which is certainly not a good sign for humanity!
