In the most recent period, the strains within the LP.8.1 family that have demonstrated relatively faster growth potential are primarily LP.8.1.1, NY.9, and NY.3.1.1.



Within the LF.7 family, the predominant variants are primarily composed of the following strains: LF.7.7.2, LF.7.9.1, and PL.1.1!



The most frequently observed convergent mutations include S:T345S, S:K440R, S:L441R, S:R765L, and N:R204P. These mutations have been identified in globally prevalent variants as well as in certain regional variants. Notably, the S:T345S and S:K440R mutations demonstrate a relatively higher concentration in their distribution patterns.



PQ.1.1，PQ.3，PQ.5，NY.7.1.1，NY.17.2。
