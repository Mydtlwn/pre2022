For some time now, XBB.1.5 has been occupying a very high percentage.
Of the many sub-branches of XBB.1.5, XBB.1.5.3 and XBB.1.5.2 maintain a high share, with XBB.1.5.2 declining slightly in recent times and XBB.1.5.1 steadily increasing in share.
At present, XBB.1.5.4, XBB.1.5.6, EM.1, XBB.1.5.10, XBB.1.5.12, EK.1, EK.2, EL.1 are all considered as possible pedigrees for development, and although there is no data to support them yet, they are still much in demand
