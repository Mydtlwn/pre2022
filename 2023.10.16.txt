Leaderboard information for the XBB.1.5 family: GK.1.1, JD.1.1. JD.1.1 has seen rapid growth potential in recent times, and perhaps further breakdowns.
Of note are FD.5.1 and GN.1.3. in particular, GN.1.3 has once again gained new gainful mutations on top of the original, FD.5.1 has a very similar composition to FD.1.1, but they are things on different branches, FD.5.1 also has a gainful spiking mutation that FD.1.1 does not have, and the more recent GS.4.1 in some regions and the previously CH.1.1.1 both carry this mutation.


Ladder Standings: XBB.1.9 Family: FL.1.5.1, EG.6.1, HN.1.
