Points list data over the last ten days is as follows:
Leaderboard information for the XBB.1.5 family: GK.1.1, JD.1.1. JD.1.1 has seen rapid growth potential in recent times, and perhaps further breakdowns.
Of note are FD.5.1 and GN.1.3. in particular, GN.1.3 has once again gained new gainful mutations on top of the original, FD.5.1 has a very similar composition to FD.1.1, but they are things on different branches, FD.5.1 also has a gainful spiking mutation that FD.1.1 does not have, and the more recent GS.4.1 in some regions and the previously CH.1.1.1 both carry this mutation.


Ladder Standings: XBB.1.9 Family: FL.1.5.1, EG.6.1, HN.1.


EG.5.1 family: HV.1, EG.5.1.1, EG.5.1.4, EG.5.1.3, HK.3.


XBB.1.16 Family: First Order: XBB.1.16.6, XBB.1.16.11, HF.1, JF.1, XBB.1.16.15.


Second ladder: FU.2, XBB.1.16.1, HF.1.1.


Family XBB.2.3: GJ.1.2, GE.1, GJ.1.2.2.



The S:P809S and S:P809L, S:P809T mutations are interesting mutations.JR.1.1 may be one of the dark horses among the next phase.There is more strain information to be compiled this week, and due to the large number of strains specified this week, some of the information will be finalized in the next issue.
