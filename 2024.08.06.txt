Recently, the main prevalent branches of KP.3 include KP.3.1.1, KP.3.3, KP.3.1, KP.3.2.3, and KP.3.2.


The LB.1.7 strain has been growing rapidly in recent times, and the reason for this may be linked to newly occurred mutations. Among these mutations, there are some that are not considered to be "spike" mutations but are nevertheless branches that are growing at a fast pace. These particular branches may require expedited designation and attention. It is important to closely monitor the evolution and spread of such strains to better understand their impact on disease transmission and severity.


It appears that not only are there branches of XDV.1 that carry the S:F59S mutation, but there may also be some branches that harbor the S:F59L mutation.


In the past period, the branches with long deletion mutations, particularly those within the 184_189 region, did not exhibit significant growth advantages. However, in recent times, their growth advantages have gradually increased, and their growth rates have accelerated. Additionally, the S:K478Q mutation has begun to appear frequently.
