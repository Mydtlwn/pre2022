Recently, the main prevalent branches of KP.3 include KP.3.1.1, KP.3.3, KP.3.1, KP.3.2.3, and KP.3.2.


The LB.1.7 strain has been growing rapidly in recent times, and the reason for this may be linked to newly occurred mutations. Among these mutations, there are some that are not considered to be "spike" mutations but are nevertheless branches that are growing at a fast pace. These particular branches may require expedited designation and attention. It is important to closely monitor the evolution and spread of such strains to better understand their impact on disease transmission and severity.
