Recently, within the XFG family, the branches that continue to exhibit rapid growth primarily include XFG.3.4.1, XFG.3.1, and XFG.2.



Within the NB.1.8.1 family, the three branches demonstrating relatively high growth potential recently are PQ.2.2, PQ.4.1, and PQ.3.



Within the recent LF.7 family, the branches that continue to maintain growth momentum primarily include PY.1.1.1, PY.1.4.1, and LF.7.9.1.





Within the recent LP.8.1 family, the predominant branches in terms of competitive advantage are NW.1.2, NW.1, and NY.9.



Globally, multiple viral lineages are demonstrating convergent evolution in spike protein mutations, specifically S:K679R, S:S680P, and S:S704L. Beyond these three major convergent mutations, the S:A376S mutation is also prevalent. Additionally, to a certain extent, some strains are exhibiting partial convergence in the S:L335F mutation.


In certain regions, convergent evolution is predominantly observed in the S:I478T and S:T572I spike protein mutations. Notably, northern regions exhibit clusters primarily composed of the S:T572I mutation, while southern regions are dominated by the S:I478T mutation. Additionally, the southern regions include the PQ.2.2 variant as a major lineage, whereas northern regions are primarily driven by the PQ.4.1 strain.It has now been confirmed that new variants carrying the S:T572I mutation have emerged. Beyond the three previously identified variants, there may exist an undocumented fourth lineage also harboring the S:T572I mutation. Furthermore, the S:I478T mutation has generated novel sub-lineages, with some branches of S:I478T already giving rise to new sub-branches containing additional mutations.








Among the recently designated viral strains, there may exist lineages with potential threats as follows:PQ.2.3ï¼ŒMC.46.1
