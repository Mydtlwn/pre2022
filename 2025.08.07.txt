Recently, within the XFG family, the branches that continue to exhibit rapid growth primarily include XFG.3.4.1, XFG.3.1, and XFG.2.



Within the NB.1.8.1 family, the three branches demonstrating relatively high growth potential recently are PQ.2.2, PQ.4.1, and PQ.3.



Within the recent LF.7 family, the branches that continue to maintain growth momentum primarily include PY.1.1.1, PY.1.4.1, and LF.7.9.1.





Within the recent LP.8.1 family, the predominant branches in terms of competitive advantage are NW.1.2, NW.1, and NY.9.



Globally, multiple viral lineages are demonstrating convergent evolution in spike protein mutations, specifically S:K679R, S:S680P, and S:S704L. Beyond these three major convergent mutations, the S:A376S mutation is also prevalent. Additionally, to a certain extent, some strains are exhibiting partial convergence in the S:L335F mutation.
