Three converging mutations, S:S31Del, S:F59X, and S:S60X, among which S:S31Del has now gained significant momentum in growth. Although the current situation with S:F59X and S:S60X is unclear, the mutations S:S31F and S:S31P, However, in the early stages of competition with mutations like S:F456L, S:R346T, and S:T572I, the S:S31F and S:S31P mutations did not demonstrate dominance. On the contrary, the S:S31Del mutation showed a significant growth advantage. The use of 'X' in mutations like S:F59X and S:S60X is because the mutated amino acid may not be the same as it is currently
