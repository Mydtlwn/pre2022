Currently, in addition to the prevailing NB.1.8.1 strain, XFG strain, PF.2.2.1 strain, and PL.1 strain, other strains are also attempting convergent mutations as much as possible. Considering that certain variants may again pose challenges to existing strains in the future, we list the existing convergent mutations or combinations of convergent mutations that may be advantageous in emerging variants.


Among the potentially concerning mutation combinations or mutations that warrant surveillance are: Firstly, the combination of S:R346T and S:R765L mutations. As previously observed, during the 2024 circulation, successful mutations rarely emerged with only a single convergent mutation. Especially following the S:S31del mutation, nearly all prevalent mutations carried paired convergent mutations, such as S:T22N with S:F59S, S:H445R with S:R346T, and S:Q493E with S:A435S. Even currently, combinations like S:Q493E paired with S:A435S persist, though only a limited number of remaining possibilities exist for new mutation pairs, such as S:T572I or S:S60P. Notably, the S:R765L and S:R765S mutations represent recently emerged convergent mutations, observed in variants like NY.3 and NY.4.1. These convergent mutations do not appear arbitrarily; even those that previously caused limited impact, such as S:N487D and S:L441R, were under surveillance before becoming threatening in variants like LP.8.1.2, XFG, XFJ, and LF.7.9. The co-occurrence of S:R765L and S:R346T is not limited to the designated MC.41 lineage but has also been detected in an unnamed branch of the XEC variant. This suggests a potentially alarming development!

The combination of the S:R765L and S:R346T mutations warrants vigilance and close monitoring to observe if they emerge in other lineages. The N:R204P mutation, once a defining mutation in a specific lineage of the KP.3 strain, is currently undergoing convergent evolution. Evidence from certain lineages indicates that this mutation confers a selective advantage to the virus, and the pattern of convergence is becoming increasingly evident. Similarly, the S:K481R mutation shares parallels with S:H445R, as both involve recurrent or even tertiary mutations at the same amino acid position. Of particular interest is the S:N450D mutationâ€”whether it will undergo further amino acid substitutions remains an intriguing and noteworthy question.
