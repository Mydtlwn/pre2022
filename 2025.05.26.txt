Currently, in addition to the prevailing NB.1.8.1 strain, XFG strain, PF.2.2.1 strain, and PL.1 strain, other strains are also attempting convergent mutations as much as possible. Considering that certain variants may again pose challenges to existing strains in the future, we list the existing convergent mutations or combinations of convergent mutations that may be advantageous in emerging variants.
