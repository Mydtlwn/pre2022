JN.1 family and JN.1.1 family and JN.2 family, some branches of JN.3 exist that are worth designating. In addition to this, some recombinant strains also have a lot of value that needs to be designated.



For list information, BA.2.86 family: JN.1, JN.1.1, BA.2.86.1.



EG.5.1 family: HV.1, HK.3, EG.5.1.1, JG.3, EG.5.1.6.



HV.1 family: HV.1.1, HV.1.2, HV.1.6.


XBB.1.16 family: XBB.1.16.6, XBB.1.16.11, JF.1, XBB.1.16.15, HF.1. It is important to note that the share of XBB.1.16.11 has slipped even closer, and that JF.1 will likely move up the rankings in the XBB.1.16 family by the next time.



The XBB.1.5 family is dominated by JD.1.1, GK.1.1, and JD.1.1.1, and attention needs to be paid to the fact that there are a number of new strains that need to be designated in the JD.1.1 family and the JD.1.1.1 family.



The XBB.1.9 family is dominated by the FL.1.5.1 family, and it is worth stating that growth is also occurring in the other FL.15.1.1 and its progeny, as well as in the progeny of FL.1.5.2.



Currently, strains with the potential to be dark horses, HN.4.1.1, XDK, KH.1, JN.1.3，JF.1.1.1，JF.1.1.2
