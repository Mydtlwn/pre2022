Recent data show that the BA.2.86 family has been dominated by JN.1, JN.1.1, BA.2.86.1, JN.1.2, and JN.3 in the recent past. Recently, globally, JN.1.2 has shown high growth. Currently, there are strains in JN.1, JN.1.1, and JN.1.2 that need to be defined as soon as possible.




EG.5.1 family: HV.1, HK.3, JG.3, HV.1.1, EG.5.1.1. It is important to note that JG.3.2 and its subsequent evolutionary branches show a very strong growth rate, but of course keep an eye on the HV.1.6.1 strain.



The XBB.1.5 family is dominated by JD.1.1, JD.1.1.1, the XBB.1.9 family is dominated by the FL.1.5.1 family, and the XBB.2.3 family is dominated by GE.1.2, which cannot be determined at this time to be a sub-branch of the defined GE.1.2. Globally, the KH.1 strain is still growing at a fast rate.



XBB.1.16 family: XBB.1.16.6, JF.1, XBB.1.16.11.
