Under the recent circumstances, the main potential superior strains of the KP.3 family are KP.3.1.1, KP.3.3, and KP.3.1.



Recently, the mutations S:P85Q, S:P85S, S:K478T, and S:K478Q have shown new potential, particularly the S:K478T and S:K478Q mutations. One of the mutations at position 478 of the spike protein is a reversion mutation. Since the emergence of the omicron variant, the mutation at position 478 has persisted up until now, spanning a considerable period of time.






In the latest period, the strains with potential growth advantages may include: LF.7, LF.8.1.1, XDV.1.1, XDV.1.2.1, XDV.1.3, XDV.1.5, XDV.1.6,XDV.1.10,XEC,KP2.3.6,LP.1.2,LP.4,LB.1.2.3,KP.2.18,MC.2.1，MC.3,MC.4,MQ.1,KP.2.15.1，LB.1.3.3,KR.1.3,and MP.1.1.
