Under the recent circumstances, the main potential superior strains of the KP.3 family are KP.3.1.1, KP.3.3, and KP.3.1.



Recently, the mutations S:P85Q, S:P85S, S:K478T, and S:K478Q have shown new potential, particularly the S:K478T and S:K478Q mutations. One of the mutations at position 478 of the spike protein is a reversion mutation. Since the emergence of the omicron variant, the mutation at position 478 has persisted up until now, spanning a considerable period of time.
